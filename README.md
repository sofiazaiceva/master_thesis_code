# master_thesis_code
This repository contains the SuperCollider code examples and implementations discussed in my master's thesis "Fluid Sonic Architectures: Performing Spatial Sound through Creative Coding" (Sibelius Academy, UniArts Helsinki, 2025).


Dependencies
These examples require additional SuperCollider extensions:

The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK)
SC-HOA library
PitchShiftPA Quark

Related Research
This code accompanies the research conducted for master's thesis, which explores applications of spatial sound performance practices and tools within creative coding environments, specifically using SuperCollider as a primary tool for live experimental electronic music.
